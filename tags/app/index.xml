      <title>Building a Multi-platform App with SwiftUI</title>

      <description>The Introduction to SwiftUI session at WWDC 2020 included content that focused on using SwiftUI to build multi-platform apps - i.e apps that work on both iOS and macOS. Building such apps can be done by separately building for each platform from a single codebase, or creating a Mac Catalyst app which runs an app built for iPad on macOS. In this post, Rick Wierenga looks at the former, providing a tutorial that shows us how to use a single codebase to build a HackerNews app for each platform.</description>

      <description>This open-source SwiftUI app created by Thomas Ricouard is a Reddit client for macOS. It&#39;s great to see apps like this being developed as open-source projects, as it provides opportunities for collaboration and learning from others in the Swift community. Note - you need macOS Big Sur to run this app.</description>

      <title>StackOv - An open-source SwiftUI Stack Overflow client for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS</title>

      <description>SwiftUI is still relatively new, and so the number of pure SwiftUI apps (i.e no UIKit) in the App store is probably low. This open-source app - a Stack Overflow client for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS - is very nearly 100% SwiftUI, with UIKit really only being used for app lifecycle management. This is a great reference if you are working on your own SwiftUI app.</description>
