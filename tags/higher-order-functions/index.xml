      <description>Higher-order functions accept one or more functions as arguments, return a function, or do both. Swift&#39;s higher-order functions, such as map and reduce, enable us to implement complex algorithms in a simplified manner. In this post, Lee Kah Seng provides five examples of such implementations.</description>

      <description>A higher order function is a function which takes a function as an argument, or returns a function. In this post from the Swift forums, Erica Sadun pitches a proposal to rename Swift&#39;s higher order functions, such as map and filter, based on the Swift API design guidelines. It&#39;s something which can be done without causing breaking changes, and I am in favour of the proposal.</description>

      <description>Swift&#39;s functional aspects such as immutability and higher order functions (functions which allow functions/closures as parameters/return values) are awesome. In this post, Craig Grummitt looks at the latter, presenting examples of how we can use Swift&#39;s higher order functions to perform operations on collections.</description>
