      <description>Protocols enable us to define a blueprint of methods and properties suited to a particular task. Classes, structures, and enums can then adopt protocols and provide their implementation of those methods and properties. With Swift 5, protocol definitions can constrain their conforming types to those that subclass a particular class. In this post, Sarun Wongpatcharapakorn describes how to add such a constraint and explains the benefits of doing so.</description>

      <description>With the official Swift 4 release imminent, it‚Äôs time to start planning the next evolution of the language. In this update Ted Kremenek outlines the primary goals of the the next development major versions, Swift 5. It‚Äôs not surprising to see API stability being the primary focus, as it was discussed as a goal for Swift 4. Reading this reminds me how awesome it is that Swift is being developed in the open. Start your engines! üèé.</description>
