In this post, Peter Friese helps us get started with async/await, demonstrating how it interacts with SwiftUI and its latest features.</description>

      <description>Swift 5.5, available in any Xcode 13 beta, includes a huge number of changes to the language. At WWDC this year, a lot of these changes were covered by session videos. However, despite being published before WWDC, this in-depth article from Paul Hudson is still worth a read. Paul walks through most of the language changes introduced in Swift 5.5, with code samples for each. Lot&#39;s to cover here.</description>

      <description>Core Data is an object graph and persistence framework provided by Apple. Introduced in iOS 3.0, it&#39;s still relevant but is also generally acknowledged as not being particularly Swift friendly. In this post, the excellent Daniel Steinberg makes an early prediction for a Swift replacement of Core Data which he thinks might be unveiled at this year&#39;s WWDC.</description>
