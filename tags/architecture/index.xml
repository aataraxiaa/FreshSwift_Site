      <description>This is a great post from Scott Berrevoets in which he describes the evolution of iOS app architecture at Lyft. Scott first describes the problems with the original app architecture and then details how concepts such as dependency injection and plugins addressed these problems. Swift code samples included.</description>

      <title>SwiftUI: Double-Edged Sword</title>

      <description>I really like this short post from Mohsen Alijanpour. One of the many benefits of migrating to SwiftUI from the world of UIKit, which assumes we will build using the MVC pattern, is that SwiftUI is architecure-less. That is, SwiftUI doesn&#39;t assume what architectural pattern we will use when building. Here, Mohsen highlights this freedom, while also reminding us that such freedom comes at the cost of more responsibility.</description>

      <description>This is an interesting article from Basem Emara in which he presents his version of a clean app architecture. Basem bases his architecture on an idea by the well known software engineer Robert Martin.</description>

      <title>Blurring the Lines Between MVVM and VIPER</title>
      <link>https://theswiftpost.co/blurring-the-lines-between-mvvm-and-viper/</link>

      <description>Göksel Köksal explains why he thinks MVVM and VIPER are not so different. Göksel starts by explaining the components of each software architecture, before showing us why using one doesn’t necessarily mean abandoning the other. Swift code examples are of course included 😃.</description>
