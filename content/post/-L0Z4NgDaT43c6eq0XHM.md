title: "Swift Evolution moves to Discourse"
subtitle: "Swift Evolution has up until now used mailing lists for all community discussions. While mailing lists served the purpose adequately, they were not ideal. Now, the move to Discourse is under way. Discourse provides a more modern, forum-based solution, and itâ€™s where all Swift community discussions will now happen."
