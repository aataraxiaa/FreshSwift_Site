title: "SwiftUI: Two equal width columns"
subtitle: "SwiftUI provides built-in view modifiers which we can apply to views to produce a different version of the original view. One such modifier is frame(width:height:alignment:), which when applied to a view positions it within an invisible frame with the specified size. In this post, Noah Gilmore shows us how we can use the frame modifier to create a view consisting of two equal width columns."
