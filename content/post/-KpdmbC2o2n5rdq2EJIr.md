title: "Struct References"
subtitle: "Great article from Chris Eidhof in which he looks to combine the usage of references types and value types to get the best of both worlds. He uses new Swift 4 features such as keypaths and generic subscripts together with existing Swift features to create types which are mutable and observable, while also having underlying value type data."
