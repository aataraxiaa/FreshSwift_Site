title: "Building a declarative animation framework in Swift - Part 1"
subtitle: "John Sundell with the first in a series of posts on building a declarative animation framework in Swift. We have probably all written animation code using UIViewâ€™s animation API consisting of n-level nested closures, which soon becomes hard to read and even harder to tweak. The approach John presents avoids such issues, and could easily be adopted in any iOS project."
