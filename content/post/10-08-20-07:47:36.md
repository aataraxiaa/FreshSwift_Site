title: "Building a Multi-platform App with SwiftUI"
subtitle: "The Introduction to SwiftUI session at WWDC 2020 included content that focused on using SwiftUI to build multi-platform apps - i.e apps that work on both iOS and macOS. Building such apps can be done by separately building for each platform from a single codebase, or creating a Mac Catalyst app which runs an app built for iPad on macOS. In this post, Rick Wierenga looks at the former, providing a tutorial that shows us how to use a single codebase to build a HackerNews app for each platform."
