title: "Swift Performance"
subtitle: "Matt Gallagher talks about high performance Swift. He looks at the sort of code that might be run millions of times - i.e low level code rather than abstractions. It’s a really interesting talk, and it’s great to dive in to the low level stuff when we probably spend most of our time working with higher level abstractions."
