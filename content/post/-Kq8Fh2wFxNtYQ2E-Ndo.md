title: "The Swift Evolution Process"
subtitle: "With Swift being open-source, it is inevitable that people will have differing opinions on the language evolution process. In response to a discussion around the process, Chris Lattner offered his opinions on why the process works the way it does. It's a genuine and empathetic response, and some of the thoughts expressed can be applied to software engineering in general, particular around making perfect decisions up front when working in imperfect information."
