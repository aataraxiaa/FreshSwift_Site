title: "Intro to free functions in Swift"
subtitle: "This is an excellent post from Jakub Turek on functional programming and free functions in Swift. Jakub guides us through a complete example of using free, generic and composable functions to transform complex data. This approach results in an implementation which is easier to read, and easier to test. Definitely one to code along to in a playground."
