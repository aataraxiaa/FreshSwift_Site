title: "Core Animation gems: Using replicator layers in Swift"
subtitle: "John Sundell shows us how CAReplicatorLayer can be a great tool for certain types of renderings and animations. He walks us through an implementation of using one image to create a tiled, animated view. CAReplicatorLayer may not be something we have cause to use regularly, but itâ€™s good to know how to use it in case the opportunity arises."
