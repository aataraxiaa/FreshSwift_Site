title: "Apple open sources key Xcode refactoring components"
subtitle: "This year at WWDC 2017, Apple delivered Xcode 9 beta. This release includes a new refactoring feature that supports the refactoring of Swift. This was great news and something the community eagerly awaited. Shortly after, Ted Kremenek took to the message boards to make another announcement - Apple will be open sourcing key parts of the engine that power the Xcode file-level transformations. Itâ€™s always great to see an organization open sourcing, and even more so when it comes to tooling."
