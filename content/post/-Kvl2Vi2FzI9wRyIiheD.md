title: "Why many developers still prefer Objective-C to Swift"
subtitle: "This is a great post from Paul Hudson in which he asks a number of current Objective-C developers why they have not made the move the Swift. There are some really interesting points made, and definitely many I agree with. As someone who did move from Objective-C to Swift, I still experience many of the issues they cite as reasons for sticking with Objective-C."
