title: "Swift Evolution - Introducing `Unwrappable`, a biased unwrapping protocol"
subtitle: "I really like this Swift evolution proposal from Erica Sadun and Chris Lattner. They propose an Unwrappable protocol, which introduces Optional-like behavior for any biased wrapped  type. The major benefit here is that this would extend Optional syntactic sugar to any associated-type enumeration."
