title: "Avoiding singletons in Swift"
subtitle: "John Sundell makes his case for why we should avoid using singletons. John first describes why singletons are bad, and then demonstrates some techniques to help us avoid them. Although I do agree that singletons sometimes present their own set of problems, I am not on the side of avoiding them completely. When used with care, they sometimes can be a valid solution."
