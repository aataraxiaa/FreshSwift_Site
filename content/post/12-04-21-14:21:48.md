title: "Custom Property Wrappers for SwiftUI"
subtitle: "A Swift property wrapper adds a layer of separation between code that defines a property and code that managers how a property is stored. By creating custom property wrappers, we write the management code once when we define the wrapper, and then reuse this code when we apply the wrapper to properties. In this post, Dave Delong shares some useful property wrappers that he has come up with while working on SwiftUI."
