title: "Reactive iOS Programming: Lightweight State Containers in Swift"
subtitle: "In this post, Tyler Tillage looks at an approach to managing app state using state containers. He starts by building a state container which wraps a state value, and then demonstrates how we can use this container to listen for state changes. Itâ€™s a nice approach, and something I can see myself adopting in my own projects."
