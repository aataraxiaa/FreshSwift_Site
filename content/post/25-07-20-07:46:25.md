title: "Opaque return types in Swift"
subtitle: "Swift's opaque return types allow us to hide type information for a returned value. While this language feature is likely most familiar from its usage in SwiftUI, it's a general-purpose feature that can be used in many different contexts. In this post, John Sundell takes a closer look at opaque return types, providing concrete examples of how they can be used."
