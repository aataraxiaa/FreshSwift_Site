title: "Standard library behavior change for LazyMapCollection prefix to act as a Sequence"
subtitle: "The Swift standard library provides lazy variations of its Sequence and Collection types, on which operations such as map and filter are implemented lazily. This means that the actual computations will only occur when the results are needed. In this Swift evolution pitch, Greg Titus proposes an addition to the standard library that improves the behavior of the LazyMapCollection type."
