title: "Structures vs Classes in Swift"
subtitle: "Dejan Agostini with a post explaining the difference between Swift Classes and Structures. He uses code examples to highlight the differences between the two, and advises on when we should use one over the other. We are probably all very familiar with most of the information in this post, but itâ€™s good to be reminded of how things work."
