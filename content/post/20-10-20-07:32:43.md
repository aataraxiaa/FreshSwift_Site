title: "@warn_unqualified_access"
subtitle: "Introduced in Swift 2, @warn_unqualified_access triggers a warning when the function or method it is applied to is used without a preceding qualifier, such as a module or type name. In this post, Federico Zanetello shows us how to use this attribute to discourage ambiguity between functions with the same signature."
