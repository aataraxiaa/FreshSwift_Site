title: "A deep dive into Swiftâ€™s function builders"
subtitle: "Despite not yet being an officially released language feature, Swift's function builders power SwiftUI's DSL-like API and is one of the more interesting recent additions to the language. In this deep dive, John Sundell takes a closer look at function builders, providing insights into the feature by implementing a function builder for a settings API. Like John, I hope the function builders feature goes through the Swift Evolution process sooner rather than later."
