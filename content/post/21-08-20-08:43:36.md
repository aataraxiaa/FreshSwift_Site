title: "Managing app in SwiftUI"
subtitle: "Swift 5.3 introduces the @main attribute, used to designate a type as the entry point for program execution. Combining this feature with the new App and Scene protocols from SwiftUI allows us to manage an app's lifecycle with minimal code, without needing to rely on UIKit types such as UIApplicationDelegate. In this post, Majid Jabrayilov shows us how to implement common app lifecycle events using these new features."
