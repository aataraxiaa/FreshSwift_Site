title: "Why many developers prefer Swift to Objective-C"
subtitle: "In a previous article, Paul Hudson interviewed a number of Objective-C developers, asking them why they preferred using Objective-C over Swift. In this follow up, he hopes to balance the scale as he interviews another group of developers, this time hearing from those who prefer using Swift over Objective-C. I found myself nodding along as I read their answers."
