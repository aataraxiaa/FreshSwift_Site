title: "A first look at matchedGeometryEffect"
subtitle: "SwiftUI provides great support for animation, allowing us to animate changes to views, or to a view's state. In the latest version of SwiftUI, included in the iOS 14 beta, we get a new method, matchedGeometryEffect, which defines a group of views with synchronized geometry. Combining this method with SwiftUI's support for animations allows us to animate a change in the position and size of two or more views in our view hierarchy. In this post, Sarun shows us how it's done."
