title: "Add an option to build the concurrency library for back deployment"
subtitle: "Implemented by Doug Gregor, a member of the Swift team at Apple, this unexpected pull request adds an option to build the new Swift Concurrency libraries for older versions of macOS/iOS. These libraries can then be embedded in targets deployed before macOS 12/iOS 15 to support the new concurrency features. I'm still not sure if this makes the new concurrency features fully available when working with older OS versions, but this is something to watch."
