title: "Flexible layouts in SwiftUI"
subtitle: "This year SwiftUI gained two new container view types - LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid - which provide grid-style layouts with a reasonable amount of flexibility. In this post, Federico Zanetello shows us how we can build a custom grid-style view, aiming to provide an even more powerful API than is available in these native SwiftUI types."
