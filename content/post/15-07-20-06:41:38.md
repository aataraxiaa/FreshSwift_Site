title: "SwiftUI: Bridging UIKit with ScrollViewReader and DragGesture"
subtitle: "SwiftUI includes a ScrollView type, which is similar in function to its UIKit counterpart. However, until recently, SwiftUI was unable to programmatically scroll to a particular offset in the ScrollView. With iOS 14, this is now possible, and in this post, Federico Zanetello uses this new ability, together with DragGesture, to implement his own version of an index list."
