title: "Why TextView is my SwiftUI canary"
subtitle: "This is a very interesting post from Drew McCormack. Ahead of WWDC20, Drew writes about how SwiftUI's declarative style currently presents performance challenges when working with large volumes of changing model data. Drew then explains why he will be looking at how SwiftUI handles text as the framework evolves, as it's a good indication of whether SwiftUI is ready to replace UIKit/AppKit."
