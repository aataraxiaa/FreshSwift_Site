title: "The State of SwiftUI"
subtitle: "Since SwiftUI's release in 2019, Apple has continued to evolve the framework, fixing many of the issues that were present in the early versions. In this post, Peter Steinberger takes a look at the current state of SwiftUI. Although Peter doesn't recommend going all-in on SwiftUI for production apps, he does recognize that it's the future at Apple, and many of the current concerns will be resolved over the coming years."
