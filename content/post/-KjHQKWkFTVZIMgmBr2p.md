title: "Swift with a hundred engineers"
subtitle: "Uber recently undertook a complete rewrite of their main app entirely in Swift. Tuomas Artman talks about their motivations for choosing Swift, and the learnings from using Swift for such a big rewrite. Both the good and the bad a discussed, and it's unsurprising to see tooling and compile times being included as drawbacks. Very interesting."
