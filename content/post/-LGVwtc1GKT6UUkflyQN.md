title: "The Forbidden @inline Attribute in Swift"
subtitle: "Bruno Rocha looks at an obscure Swift attribute - the @inline attribute. This attribute can be used in Swift to specify if we want the compiler to perform function inlining, a common compiler optimization technique. Note that although this attribute is currently available for use, itâ€™s not something which is officially documented, and so usage is generally discouraged."
