title: "To Optional or Not to Optional: IBOutlet"
subtitle: "Official Apple documentation recommends that we use implicitly unwrapped optionals (IUOs) when declaring IBOutlets in our Swift code. It's advice most of us probably follow, but have we ever put much thought in to it? Here, Curtis Herbert explains why he will never use IUOs for his IBOutlets again, but rather will switch to using optionals."
