title: "Proposing to expand `available` to introduce `discouraged`"
subtitle: "Swift's available attribute documents characteristics of a declaration's lifecycle. This Swift evolution pitch from Erica Sadun and Chris Lattner proposes extending the available attribute, introducing discouraged, an argument that can be used to describe why using the associated declaration is discouraged. A small but useful addition to the language."
