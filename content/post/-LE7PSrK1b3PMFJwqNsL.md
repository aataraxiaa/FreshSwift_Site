title: "VisualActivityViewController - A way to represent what you’re sharing"
subtitle: "UIActivityViewControllers provide a simple way to share data with other iOS apps. However, one limitation is that we don’t see a preview of what we are sharing. This 100% Swift library from Ryan Ackermann solves this, building on top of the standard UIActivityViewController to provide a preview of the content being shared."
