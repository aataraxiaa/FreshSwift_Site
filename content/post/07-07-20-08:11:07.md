title: "Returning to an old hobbyhorse: Migrating higher order function names to comply with API guidelines"
subtitle: "A higher order function is a function which takes a function as an argument, or returns a function. In this post from the Swift forums, Erica Sadun pitches a proposal to rename Swift's higher order functions, such as map and filter, based on the Swift API design guidelines. It's something which can be done without causing breaking changes, and I am in favour of the proposal."
