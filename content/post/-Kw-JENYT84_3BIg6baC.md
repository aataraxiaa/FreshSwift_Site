title: "Xcode 9.1 Improves Display of Fatal Errors"
subtitle: "Xcode 9.1 significantly improves itâ€™s user feedback when a Swift program terminates due to fatal error. Prior to Xcode 9.1, when a program terminated due to fatal error, the user was often left confused by the non-descriptive error message displayed. With the latest beta, Xcode will now display the reason for the fatal error termination. A nice improvement."
