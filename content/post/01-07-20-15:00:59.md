title: "SwiftUI: Double-Edged Sword"
subtitle: "I really like this short post from Mohsen Alijanpour. One of the many benefits of migrating to SwiftUI from the world of UIKit, which assumes we will build using the MVC pattern, is that SwiftUI is architecure-less. That is, SwiftUI doesn't assume what architectural pattern we will use when building. Here, Mohsen highlights this freedom, while also reminding us that such freedom comes at the cost of more responsibility."
