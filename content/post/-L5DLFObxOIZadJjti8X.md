title: "Transforming collections in Swift"
subtitle: "In this entry of his regular Swift blog series, John Sundell looks at how we can transform collections using standard library APIs. No doubt most of us are familiar with map, flatMap etc., but it’s good to refresh our knowledge. Also, I tend to forget about the zip function, so I was happy to be reminded of it’s usefulness."
