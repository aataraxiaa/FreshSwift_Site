title: "Adding support for versioning and migration to your Codable models."
subtitle: "I really like this idea from Krzysztof Zab≈Çocki that adds support for versioning to Codable models. It's super lightweight, involving conformance to a single protocol and a custom decoder with one method, but allows us to decode any versioned model and apply all necessary migrations."
