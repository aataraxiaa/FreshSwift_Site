title: "JSON to Swift with Decoder and Decodable"
subtitle: "After looking at encoding Swift to JSON in a previous post, Greg Heo turns his attention to decoding JSON to Swift using Swift 4â€™s Decodable and Decoder protocols. As with the previous article, Greg steps through a complete example. The simplicity of the example, together with the diagrams, really help to explain how the decoding process works."
