title: "Swift’s Evolution"
subtitle: "Interest post from Justin Williams in which he shares his thoughts on the evolution of Swift. Justin takes a rather dim view of how Swift is evolving, but he does raise some valid points. It can be frustrating to adopt a language and then see changes being made to it which we don’t agree with. However, I think in general, the core Swift team and the community do a pretty good job of deciding what should be addressed in each Swift release."
