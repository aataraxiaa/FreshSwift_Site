title: "5 Complex Algorithms Simplified Using Swiftâ€™s Higher-Order Functions"
subtitle: "Higher-order functions accept one or more functions as arguments, return a function, or do both. Swift's higher-order functions, such as map and reduce, enable us to implement complex algorithms in a simplified manner. In this post, Lee Kah Seng provides five examples of such implementations."
