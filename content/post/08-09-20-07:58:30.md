title: "Save Custom Codable Types in AppStorage or SceneStorage"
subtitle: "AppStorage and SceneStorage are SwiftUI property wrappers designed for data persistence. Both of these property wrappers support Swift value types such as Bool, Int, etc. However, to use these property wrappers with custom codable types, we need to add RawRepresentable conformance to the types. In this post, Natalia Panferova shows us how to do this."
