title: "What's new in Swift 5.5?"
subtitle: "Swift 5.5, available in any Xcode 13 beta, includes a huge number of changes to the language. At WWDC this year, a lot of these changes were covered by session videos. However, despite being published before WWDC, this in-depth article from Paul Hudson is still worth a read. Paul walks through most of the language changes introduced in Swift 5.5, with code samples for each. Lot's to cover here."
