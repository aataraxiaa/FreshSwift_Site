title: "Why is it called a Closure anyway?"
subtitle: "Closures are a super-useful feature of Swift (and many other programming languages) which allow us to capture variables and pass functionality around in our code. In this short post, Andrew Bancroft offers his own take on why a closure is called a closure. For me, knowing that it closes over variables was always enough to justify the naming, but itâ€™s fun to see someone search for their own reasoning."
