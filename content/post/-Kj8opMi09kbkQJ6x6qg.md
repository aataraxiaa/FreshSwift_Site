title: "SE-1069: Improve interactions between private declarations and extensions"
subtitle: "I'm very happy to see this Swift evolution proposal accepted. The private access modifier in Swift 4 will have a slightly wider scope, and become more usable. With this, extensions to a type declared within the same file will have access to private members. It's a change which further supports the idea that type extensions should be used as  a code-organization tool"
