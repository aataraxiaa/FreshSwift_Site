title: "Dark side of extensions in Swift"
subtitle: "Swift Extensions add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enum, or protocol type. In this post, Dmitrii Ivanov outlines what he considers to be some of the drawbacks of using extensions. I don't fully agree with everything Dmitrii covers, but as he says, his goal is not to dissuade us from using extensions but to remind us of the nuances of using this language feature."
