title: "A story about Swift source compatibility"
subtitle: "The Swift source compatibility suite is a community owned project which serves to regression test changes to the Swift compiler. Projects added are periodically built against the latest development versions of Swift, helping us to better understand the impact of changes to the language. In this post, Jesse Squires tells the story of one of his own open source projects, and why adding it to the compatibility suite sooner rather than later would have prevented a regression in the Swift compiler."
