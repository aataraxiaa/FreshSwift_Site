title: "Be careful with Obj-C bridging in Swift"
subtitle: "Type casting in Swift allows us to treat an instance as a different instance of a superclass or subclass from its hierarchy. It's accomplished using the as operator. However, did you know that the as operator is also the Objective-C bridging operator? In this post, Bruno Rocha explains why we need to pay extra attention when casting to make sure we are not also bridging from Swift to Objective-C types."
