subtitle: "With the official Swift 4 release imminent, it’s time to start planning the next evolution of the language. In this update Ted Kremenek outlines the primary goals of the the next development major versions, Swift 5. It’s not surprising to see API stability being the primary focus, as it was discussed as a goal for Swift 4. Reading this reminds me how awesome it is that Swift is being developed in the open. Start your engines! 🏎."
