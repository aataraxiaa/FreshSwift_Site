title: "Re: Making Wrong Code Look Wrong"
subtitle: "Based on an [old blog post](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/) by Joel Spolsky, Maxwell Anselm describes how serious software development challenges from the past are basically non-issues in modern languages like Swift. This is a great read, and really highlights the progress that has been made in programming language design."
