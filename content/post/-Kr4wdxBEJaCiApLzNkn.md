title: "Exploring Swift Closures"
subtitle: "Kevin Farst explores an invaluable part of the Swift language - closures. Kevin provides some tips such as using typealias to define commonly used closures, and provides examples of using closures to improve our code. Even if we are overly familiar with closures, itâ€™s good to remind ourselves how we can best use them to make our life a little easier."
