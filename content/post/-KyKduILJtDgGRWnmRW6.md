title: "Using tokens to handle async Swift code"
subtitle: "John Sundell shows us how we can use request tokens to improve our asynchronous APIs. As John points out, most codebases will include some sort of asynchronous method calls, and having the ability to cancel such calls can be useful. Using request tokens is one way we can provide such an ability."
