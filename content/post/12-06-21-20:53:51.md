title: "Simpler way to deal with hardcoded ViewModifer values in SwiftUI"
subtitle: "When working with SwiftUI, it's likely that at some point we will want to configure a property of our UI based on a conditional value. For example, setting a font color to red when an error occurs. However, as Daniel Tavares explains in this post, this can become cumbersome when we have a lot of UI properties that depend on conditional values. Luckily, Daniel has something which can help, and he shares it with us in this post."
