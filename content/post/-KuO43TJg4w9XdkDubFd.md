title: "Swift Error Handling Implementation"
subtitle: "Mike Ash with another entry in his great Friday Q&A series. In this post, Mike looks at how Swift error handling works on the inside. He looks at error handling in both Swift 3 and Swift 4, and then compares Swift error handling to exception handling in other languages. Very interesting."
