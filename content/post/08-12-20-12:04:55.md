title: "Codable synthesis for enums with associated values"
subtitle: "Swift 4 introduced support for automatically synthesizing conformance to the Encodable and Decodable protocols. It's a useful feature, most likely used by any application which handles JSON-based network requests. This Swift evolution pitch from Dario Rexin proposes extending auto-synthesis of these conformances to enums with associated values. I'm sure we will see this in an upcoming Swift version."
