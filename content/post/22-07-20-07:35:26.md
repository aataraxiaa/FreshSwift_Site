title: "StackOv - An open-source SwiftUI Stack Overflow client for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS"
subtitle: "SwiftUI is still relatively new, and so the number of pure SwiftUI apps (i.e no UIKit) in the App store is probably low. This open-source app - a Stack Overflow client for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS - is very nearly 100% SwiftUI, with UIKit really only being used for app lifecycle management. This is a great reference if you are working on your own SwiftUI app."
