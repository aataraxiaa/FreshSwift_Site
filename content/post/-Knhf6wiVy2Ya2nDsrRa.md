title: "JSON Parsing in Swift 4"
subtitle: "Parsing JSON with Swift 3 and below is a cumbersome task. It either means a lot of boilerplate code to convert JSON to strictly-typed Swift, or using one of the many third-party libraries to do the job for us. This all changes in Swift 4, with the introduction of the Encodable & Decodable protocols. This great article by TrozWare shows us exactly what we need to know to easily parse JSON using Swift 4."
