title: "Swift Unwrapped #86: Tuples"
subtitle: "Tuples are a Swift compound type consisting of a comma-separated list of types, enclosed in parentheses. They are probably most often used to return multiple values from a function. In this episode of the Swift Unwrapped podcast, Jesse Squires and JP Simard use a Swift evolution proposal as a starting point for a discussion about tuples, and compare the type against named types such as structures and classes."
