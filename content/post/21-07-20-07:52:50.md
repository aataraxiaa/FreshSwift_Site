title: "Forward scan matching for trailing closures"
subtitle: "Swift 5.3 extended trailing closure syntax, allowing additional labeled trailing closures to follow an initial un-labeled trailing closure. In this Swift evolution pitch, Doug Gregor from the Swift Core Team proposes an improvement to how the Swift compiler scans and matches trailing closure arguments to parameters. This is a source-breaking change, but Doug believes that it's worth doing now to get an improved scanning model sooner."
