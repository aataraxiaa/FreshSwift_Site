title: "SwiftUI Property Wrappers"
subtitle: "SwiftUI provides a variety of property wrappers that we can leverage to manage state and data flow in our applications. Deciding which property wrapper to use depends on several factors, such as the type of data being wrapped, how the data is used, and how the SwiftUI view receives the data. This site, created by Donny Wals, is a quick reference when making such a decision. Definitely one to bookmark."
