title: "Creating custom .redacted effects"
subtitle: "The latest version of SwiftUI, available in Xcode 12, includes a redacted(reason:) view modifier. This modifier is used to hide the content of SwiftUI views, and while useful, is currently quite limited in the API it provides. In this post, Federico Zanetello explores how we can expand on what is currently available by adding custom redacted effects."
