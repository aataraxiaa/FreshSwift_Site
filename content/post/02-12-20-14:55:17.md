title: "What went wrong with the libdispatch. A tale of caution for the future of concurrency."

It aims to remove the need for developers to directly manage threads, enabling them to instead think in terms of queues of work. In this very interesting post, Thomas examines some of the problems of using libdispatch, offering words of caution for the future of concurrency in Swift."
