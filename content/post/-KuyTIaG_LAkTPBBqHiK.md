title: "Swift evolution - Non-Exhaustive Enums"
subtitle: "I really like this Swift evolution proposal from Jordan Rose. It aims to distinguish between enums which are exhaustive (they will never get new cases), and enums which are non-exhaustive, and to ensure that clients handle any future cases when dealing with the latter."
