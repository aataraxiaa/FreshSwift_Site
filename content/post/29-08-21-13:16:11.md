title: "Open Sourcing Identified Collections"
subtitle: "Most applications involve working with collections of data in some form, and it's common to model such data as a standard Array. However, as applications grow more complex, the limitations of Arrays might start to cause problems. Thankfully, this open-source library, created by the Point Free team, can help. It provides a new type called IdentifiedArray for working with collections of identifiable elements in a performant way."
