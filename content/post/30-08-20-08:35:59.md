title: "Extend implicit member syntax to cover chains of member references"
subtitle: "This Swift evolution proposal suggests an expansion of implicit member syntax to more complex expressions than just a single static member or function. What this means is that when the type of an expression is implied by the context, developers would be able to use leading dot syntax, even when the expression consists of chains of member references. This is a very logical language evolution in my opinion."
