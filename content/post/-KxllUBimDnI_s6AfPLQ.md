title: "View Bindings in Pure Swift"
subtitle: "Another good episode of Swift Talk from the guys at objc.io. In this episode, Chris and Florian experiment with reactive view bindings. They take the simple scenario of an activity indicator which needs to react to changes in state, and refactor it to bind the indicator to an observable state."
