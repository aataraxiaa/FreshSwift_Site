title: "What's new in Swift 5.3?"
subtitle: "Tibor BÃ¶decs with a post that showcases some of the latest language features coming in Swift 5.3. All of the improvements Tibor describes are really cool, but my favourite is the implementation of SE-0268, which improves didSet semantics. It's a subtle, low-profile change which improves the performance of the language."
