title: "Swift Evolution - 'Raw' mode string literals"
subtitle: "I like this Swift evolution proposal from John Holdsworth. John proposes adding a feature which allows us to use 'raw-mode' when creating string literals. This would enable us to create strings containing backslashes which are not interpreted as escaping introducers. This could be useful for regular expressions."
