title: "Performance: Actor vs queue vs lock"
subtitle: "Swift 5.5's Actor type allows only one task to access their mutable state at a time. This provides one method of implementing synchronization, which prevents threads from accessing shared data at the same time. In this short but interesting post, Marin Todorov benchmarks the performance of three methods of implementing synchronization in Swift - Actor, DispatchQueue, and Lock."
