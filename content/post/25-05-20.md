title: "The Future of Swift on the Server"
subtitle: "This is a really interesting piece from Tim Condon on the future of server-side Swift. Tim first writes about IBM's decision to step away from Swift, something which was obviously disappointing for the community. However, Tim then makes a solid argument for why he thinks the future is looking bright for Swift on the server, considering the planned roadmap for Swift 6 and numerous server-related non-Apple projects. I really like the reminder of how young Swift is, particularly when compared to language such as Go and Rust."
