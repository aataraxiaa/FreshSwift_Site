title: "New property wrappers in SwiftUI"
subtitle: "SwiftUI allows us to declaratively build our user interfaces, while also indicating data dependencies for our views. We indicate these dependencies using data management types, which are implemented in SwiftUI as property wrappers such as State and Binding. With iOS 14, SwiftUI introduces additional property wrappers to help us manage state and data flow, and in this post, Majid shows us how we can use them."
