title: "Swift 5.5 Released!"
subtitle: "Swift 5.5 is officially released, and despite only being a minor release - according to semantic versioning - it includes lots of new language capabilities. In this post to the official Swift blog, Ted Kremenek of the Swift Core Team announces the release and lists the changes and improvements. It's nice to see Ted also thanking the Swift community for their involvement in the proposals for this release."
