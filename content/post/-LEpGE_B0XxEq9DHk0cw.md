title: "On my misalignment with Apple's love affair with Swift"
subtitle: "This is an interesting post from Dominik Wagner in which he explains why he is not a fan of Swift. Although I don’t share Dominik’s overall opinion of Swift, I do agree with some of the points he makes, particularly regarding the tension that exists between Swift and existing Apple frameworks. Even if you love the language, it’s good to understand the reasons why other’s don’t."
