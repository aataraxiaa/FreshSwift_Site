title: "Swift ºs Collection Types"
subtitle: "The Swift standard library provides a whole suite of Sequence and Collection protocols, together with a large number of concrete types conforming to these protocols such as Array, Set, Dictionary, etc. In this detailed post, Harshil Shah covers all of the public types which make up Swift's Collection protocol hierarchy, examining Sequence, Collection, Array, and everything in between. An excellent post, and one to bookmark for future reference."
