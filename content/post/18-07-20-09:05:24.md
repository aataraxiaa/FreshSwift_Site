subtitle: "Two new container views - LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid - have been added to SwiftUI in iOS 14. These new container views arrange their child views in a grid that grows either vertically or horizontally, creating items only as needed. In this post, Majid demonstrates how we can create complex and adaptive layouts using these incredibly powerful new types."
