title: "Structured concurrency"
subtitle: "A lot of the sessions at this years' WWDC related to the new concurrency model in Swift. A central part of this model is the concept of structured concurrency, which enables concurrent execution of asynchronous code. The language features are now available in the latest Xcode beta, and this proposal provides lots of background on this major Swift language evolution."
