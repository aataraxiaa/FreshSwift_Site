title: "Launching Language and Platform Package Compatibility"
subtitle: "The Swift Package Index, created by Dave Verwer and Sven A. Schmidt, is a search engine for packages that support the Swift Package Manager. It aims to help developers make informed decisions about the dependencies for their projects. In this blog post, the Package Index team announce the launch of language and platform package compatibility, which provides even more relevant information about each package in the index. The Package Index really is a fantastic resource, and it's great to see continued improvements like this."
