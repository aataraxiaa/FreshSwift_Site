title: "Private APIs, Objective-C runtime, and Swift"
subtitle: "Objective-C and Swift can be used together, and it's still very common for apps and projects to contain a mix of both. Calling public Objective-C APIs from Swift usually just involves exposing the APIs via a bridging header. However, calling private, or Swift-unavailable, Objective-C APIs from our Swift code is also possible, thanks to Objective-C's dynamic nature. In this post, Victor Pavlychko focuses on accessing such APIs using the Objective-C runtime."
