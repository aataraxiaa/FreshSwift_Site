title: "SwiftUI betas - what changed before 1.0"
subtitle: "SwiftUI continues to evolve, with lots of regular changes to the original APIs that were debuted at WWDC 2019. In this post, Kuba Suder presents a list of all the API changes that took place between the original beta from June 2019 and the final version from September of that year. This is especially useful if you are trying to recreate examples from WWDC 2019 videos, but are wondering why the code won't compile."
