title: "Optional Forward Application"
subtitle: "This is an interesting post from Joshua Emmons in which he looks at handling optional parameters when using failable initialisers. Joshua initially described an approach using a custom free function, before amending the post to recommend using the flatMap function available in the Swift standard library."
