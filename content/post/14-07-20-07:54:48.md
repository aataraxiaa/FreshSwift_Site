title: "SwiftUIâ€™s New App Lifecycle and Replacements for AppDelegate and SceneDelegate in iOS 14"
subtitle: "With iOS 14, it is now possible to build entire apps using only SwiftUI, avoiding the need to implement UIKit lifecycle protocols such as UIApplicationDelegate. This is made possible due to the introduction of new SwiftUI features such as the App protocol and SceneBuilder function builder. Here, Anupam Chugh shows us how we can leverage these new SwiftUI features to implement a SwiftUI app lifecycle."
