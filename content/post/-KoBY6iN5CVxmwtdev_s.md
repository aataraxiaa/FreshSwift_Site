title: "JSON with Encoder and Encodable"
subtitle: "Great post from Greg Heo in which he looks at the magic that is JSON encoding in Swift 4. He walks through every step in the process of encoding a single Int value to JSON, and looks at  the implementation. There are some twists, with parts of the implementation probable not being what you expect. An informative and fun read."
