title: "iOS 14: Notable UIKit Additions"
subtitle: "With Apple understandably putting a lot of effort into SwiftUI, it's great to see that UIKit is not being ignored. iOS 14 includes substantial updates to UIKit, and in this post from Jordan Morgan, we get a rundown of some of the new additions, with Swift code samples for each. I really like the move away from the target-action pattern to UIActions."
