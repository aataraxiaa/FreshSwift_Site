title: "Swift deinit is (sometimes) not called for throwing or failable initializers"
subtitle: "Sometimes we may want to define a struct or class for which initialization can fail, for example in response to invalid parameter values. For this use case, Swift provides failable initializers. In this post, Jesse Squires reminds us that when initialization fails, the deinitializer is not called, and provides a short history lesson to explain why this is the case."
