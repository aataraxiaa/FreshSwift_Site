title: "Swift Source Compatibility Test Suite"
subtitle: "This is an awesome, community-driven project released as part of an effort to maintain source compatibility in future Swift releases. Open-source project owners can submit projects which will then be built by Swift's continuous integration system. The goal is to monitor Swift compiler-related pull request builds, and catch any source compatibility regressions"
