title: "Force-Unwrapping in Swift is NOT a Bad Thing"
subtitle: "Swift's Optional type represents either a wrapped value or nil, the absence of a value. When a programmer is certain than an Optional contains a value, the force unwrap operator is used to unconditionally unwrap the value. In this post, Wolf McNally examines force unwrapping in Swift, arguing that force unwraps which lead to crashes are not necessarily a bad thing. This is a really good read, and I very much agree with Wolf: code only as defensively as you have to."
