title: "Invert guard let scoping"
subtitle: "In this Swift evolution pitch, Danny Sung proposes the introduction of an inverted scope guard let pattern. Danny explains that this would solve the problem of guarding against a condition, while also making an optional value associated with the condition available inside the body of the guard statement. Although I understand the problem, I am not sure if adding negated versions of such keywords is the right solution."
