title: "Friday Q&A: Swift 4 Weak References"
subtitle: "The latest in Mike Ash’s Friday Q&A series examines Swift 4’s implementation of weak object references. Mike covers everything we need to know - from the old implementation, to what makes up an object in Swift, and finally to side tables and how they are used in the Swift 4 implementation. The new implementation is exciting, and he hopes that it will lead to features such as stored properties in extensions."
