title: "Date.now() and other calendar thoughts"
subtitle: "Dave Delong started this interesting discussion on the Swift Forums. In Daveâ€™s opinion, the current date/time APIs of Foundation are lacking,  and adding a suggested Date.now() function will only make things worse. Dave then proposes a related addition to Foundation, Clock, which would tell us the date and time of day."
