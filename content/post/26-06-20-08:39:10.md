title: "SwiftUI, UIViewRepresentable, and attributed text"
subtitle: "This is an interesting post from Benedikt Terhechte on the difficulty of handling rich text with SwiftUI 1.0. To support Markdown in his Hyperdeck app, Benedikt needed a SwiftUI type which supported rich text via attributed text. However, as there is no native SwiftUI 1.0 type which supports attributed text, Benedikt needed to look for other solutions."
