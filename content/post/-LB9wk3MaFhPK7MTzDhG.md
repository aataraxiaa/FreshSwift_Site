title: "Swift Evolution - RFC: In-Line Tests"
subtitle: "In this RFC, Robert Widmann suggests a very interesting Swift evolution idea. Robert comments that currently, unit testing in Swift feels like a second-class citizen, and comes with significant overhead. To improve the situation, he suggests the idea of in-line tests, enabling us to add unit tests right next to the code being tested. I really like this idea. 👍🏽."
